                    <p>Developers can do incredible work to enable their companies to operate, deliver, grow and “wow”
                        customers, and your team is no different.</p>
                    <p>You have extraordinary talent at your disposal but they’re stifled by complex processes, vendor
                        lock-in and limited functionality. Like any profession, a developer’s ability is deeply affected by
                        the tools and support they’re provided with.</p>
                    <p>When the process of building and managing complex infrastructure can waste days and sometimes weeks
                        of valuable development time, how can you expect your business to thrive?</p>

                    <p>The Kubernetes Security Scanner is a tool developed by Appvia to simplify management of role-based
                        access controls (or RBAC) across your Kubernetes clusters.</p>
                    <p>It does this by attaching itself to multiple clusters in Kubernetes and scanning the environments for
                        RBAC data. It then maps the relationships between people, service accounts, roles, role bindings and
                        pod security policies.</p>
                    <p>In doing so, it helps visualise the complexity of RBAC and enables users to search across their
                        clusters for RBAC information and, even makes suggestions on core best practice rules around the
                        security of your RBAC implementation.</p>
                    <p>You can view the Kubernetes Security Scanner GitHub repo for more information or to download.</p>
